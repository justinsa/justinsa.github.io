Einsteinium <sub>(AM:99)</sub> is a <a title="Wikipedia: Sythetic Element" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element" target="_blank">synthetic</a> <a title="Wikipedia: Actinide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinide" target="_blank">actinide</a> nestled between <a title="Wikipedia: Californium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californium" target="_blank">Californium</a> <sub>(AM:98)</sub> and <a title="Wikipedia: Fermium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermium" target="_blank">Fermium</a> <sub>(AM:100)</sub> on the standard periodic table of the elements<sup>[<a title="Wikipedia: Einsteinium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsteinium" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>]</sup>. Highly radioactive with a daily decay rate of 3% makes Einsteinium both difficult to study and lethal. The element was first observed as a biproduct of a <a title="Wikipedia: Plutonium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium" target="_blank">Plutonium</a> <sub>(AM:94)</sub> detonation and later synthesized in a laboratory.

Unlike Einsteinium, I am neither observable after a nuclear detonation nor considered an actinide. Decay on the other hand is certainly something we share in common, though my rate of decay seems to only grow with time. In regards to decay, my body has incurred the following maladies that I will one day expand on since my own stupidity sometimes eclipses all others.
<ol>
  <li>Scarred knee caps. - It was the 80's, I was perhaps 4 years old, and I subconsciously decided that riding a bike was less enjoyable than flying over the handlebars. My knees have lasting reminders of their introduction to ashphalt.</li>
  <li>A scarred chin - Picture a BMX bicycle with a curb hop going horribly awry.</li>
  <li>A scarred left shin - I was an accident victim for one Halloween during my formative years. Unfortunately I applied real make-up to my shin at one point.</li>
  <li>A broken left radius - this happens to 11 year olds who run backwards on gymnasium floors since rubber and high tack surfaces tend to cling suddenly.</li>
  <li>A broken right clavical - let's just leave this one at I had a blossoming life in drama (theatre) class and sometimes taxi cabs hit leprechauns... with unforeseen consequences in the mind of a 15 year old.</li>
  <li>A right knee that went backwards - one <a title="North Shore Taekwondo" href="http://northshoretaekwondo.com" target="_blank">Taekwondo</a> front kick later and welcome to 6 weeks of recovery.</li>
  <li>The same knee goes left - Golf! Who would have thought golf would cause this!</li>
  <li>The same knee goes left... again - One knee + one scrum + one collapsed ruck = one damaged knee... again.</li>
  <li>A distressed left fascia - My multi-year romance with Capoeira (<a title="Grupo Axe Capoeira: Victoria, BC, Canada" href="http://axecapoeira.tv/grupo.html" target="_blank">Grupo Axe</a>) had some bumps along the way, one being my anterior fascia trying to divorce my left knee.</li>
  <li>A distressed right knee - Moviegoers sign is <em>"an often bilateral knee stiffness and pain which occurs after prolonged sitting in patients with patellofemoral joint pain, which the patient tries to address by periodically trying to straighten his/her leg"</em> <sup>[<a title="The Free Dictionary: Moviegoers Sign" href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Moviegoers+Sign" target="_blank">The Free Dictionary</a>]</sup>. Bad squat form and my love of CrossFit (<a title="CrossFit Ireland" href="http://crossfit.ie/" target="_blank">CrossFit Ireland</a>, <a title="CrossFit Mountain View" href="http://crossfitmountainview.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Mountain View</a>) got me this gift at the tender age of 31.</li>

I have started this site to provide my daughter (due on January 4<sup>th</sup>, 2012) with insight in to her father many years down the road.
